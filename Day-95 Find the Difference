FIND THE DIFFERENCE

Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.
String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.
Find the letter that was added in t.

Example:
Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e

Explanation:
'e' is the letter that was added.

Testcase:
Input: 
s = "aa"
t = "a"

Output:
a

Approach: Check if the charcter in string t is not present in string s or 
          If frequency of character in t is not equal to frequency of character in s.
          Then return that character.
          
#Code
class Solution:
    def findTheDifference(self, s: str, t: str) -> str:
        for i in t:
            if i not in s or t.count(i) != s.count(i):
                return i
