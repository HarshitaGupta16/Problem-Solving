SUM OF TWO INTEGERS
Calculate the sum of two integers a and b, but you are not allowed to use the operator + and -.

Example 1:
Input: a = 1, b = 2
Output: 3

Example 2:
Input: a = -2, b = 3
Output: 1

Approach: Add number b to a one by one by decreasing it by 1, till it becomes 0.
          In this way, a is added to b.

class Solution:
    def getSum(self, a: int, b: int) -> int:
        while(b > 0):
            a += 1
            b -= 1
        return a
