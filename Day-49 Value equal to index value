VALUE EQUAL TO INDEX VALUE
Given an array of positive integers. Your task is to find that element whose value is equal to that of its index value.

Example:
Input:
2
5
15 2 45 12 7
1
1

Output:
2
1

Note: There can be more than one element in the array which have same value as their index.
      You need to print every such element's index separated by a single space.
      Follows 1-based indexing of the array.
      
Approach: If the index value is same as array value, append those values in the new list named lis.
          If the list is empty, print "Not Found"
          Else, print the elements of list
          
#code
t=int(input())
while t>0:
    n=int(input())
    arr=list(map(int,input().strip().split()))
    lis=[]
    for i in range(n):
        if i+1==arr[i]:
            lis.append(arr[i])
            
            
    if len(lis)==0:
        print("Not Found")
    else:
        print(*lis)
        
    t=t-1
