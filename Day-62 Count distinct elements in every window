COUNT DISTINCT ELEMENTS IN EVERY WINDOW
Given an array A[] of size N and an integer K.
Your task is to complete the function countDistinct() which prints the count of distinct numbers in all windows of size k in the array A[].

Example(To be used only for expected output):
Input:
2
7 4
1 2 1 3 4 2 3
3 2
4 1 1

Output:
3 4 4 3
2 1

Approach: Run the loop n-k+1 times.
          Use set as it only contains distinct values of window size. Window size is taken out by slicing.
          Calulate length of the set and print it with spacing.
          
# your task is to complete this function
# function should print count of windows
def countDistinct(arr, n, k):
    # Code here
    for i in range(n-k+1):
        print(len(set(arr[i:i+k])),end=" ")
    print("")
