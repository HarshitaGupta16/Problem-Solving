PALINDROME NUMBER
Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

Example 1:

Input: 121
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Example 3:

Input: 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

Approach: If the number is negative then return False.
          Store the given number in a variable.
          Take a varible rev, initialize it with 0. 
          Find the palindrome, check and return true if rev is equal to original number.
          Else, return false.

class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
        if x < 0:
            return False
        n = x
        rev = 0
        #flag="false"
        while(x != 0):
            rem = int(x % 10)
            #print(rem)
            rev = rev*10 + rem
            x = x//10
            #print(rev)
            
        #if(rev == n):
        #    flag = "true"
        #else:
        #    flag = "false"
        return n == rev
