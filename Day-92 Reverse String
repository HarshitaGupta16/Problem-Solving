REVERSE STRING
Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters char[].

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.
You may assume all the characters consist of printable ascii characters.

Example 1:
Input: ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]

Example 2:
Input: ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]

Approach: Swap the ith and n-ith-1 character. This will reverse the string.

#code
class Solution:
    def reverseString(self, s: List[str]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
        """
        n = len(s)
        for i in range(0,n//2):
            s[i],s[n-i-1] = s[n-i-1],s[i]
            #print(s[n-i-1])
            #print(s[i])
