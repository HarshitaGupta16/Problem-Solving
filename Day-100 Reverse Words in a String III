REVERSE WORDS IN A STRING III
Given a string, you need to reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while still preserving whitespace and 
initial word order.

Example 1:
Input: "Let's take LeetCode contest"
Output: "s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc"

Note: In the string, each word is separated by single space and there will not be any extra space in the string.

Approach: Input string is splited with space as parameter and put it in list.
          Take an empty list result.
          Traverse each item in the list to reverse it and append it in the result list.
          Now convert list result to string, with join method.
          Return result.

class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
        lis = s.split()
        print(lis)
        print(type(lis))
        result = []
        for item in lis:
            item =item[::-1]
            print(item)
            result.append(item)
        result = ' '.join(result)
        return result
