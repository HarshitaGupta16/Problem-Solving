BOOLEAN STRING VALUE
Given a string consisting of only 0, 1, A, B, C where
A = AND
B = OR
C = XOR
Calculate the value of the string assuming no order of precedence and evaluation is done from left to right.

Example:
Input: 
2
1C1B1B0A0
1A0B1

Output: 
0
1

Explanation:
Testcase 2: 1 AND 0 OR 1 = 1

Approach: Assign the 1st character of the string i.e any number 0 or 1 to any variable say temp.
          Run the for loop and increase by 2 steps. 
          2 numbers have 1 alphabet in between 'A','B','C'.
          Perform the operation with temp and str[i+1]. Also, convert string to int before performing any operarion.
          Return temp.
          
#code
t=int(input())
while t>0:
    s=input()
    temp = int(s[0])
    for i in range(1,len(s),2):
        if(s[i]=='A'):
            temp = temp & int(s[i+1])
        elif(s[i]=='B'):
            temp = temp | int(s[i+1])
        elif(s[i]=='C'):
            temp=temp ^ int(s[i+1])
            
    print(temp)
    t=t-1
