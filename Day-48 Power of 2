POWER OF 2
The question asks us to find if the number is power of 2 or not
Input :
2
1
98

Output :
YES
NO

Explanation:
Testcase 1:  1 is equal to 2 raised to 0 (20 == 1)

Approach: Perform bitwise AND of number and number-1.
          If result is 0 then, the number is power of 2
          else, the number is not the power of 2.

#code
t=int(input())
while t>0:
    n=int(input())
    if(n==0):
        print("NO")
    else:
        if((n & (n-1))==0):
            print("YES")
        else:
            print("NO")
    t=t-1
