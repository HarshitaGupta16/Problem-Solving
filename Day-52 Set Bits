SET BITS
Given a positive integer N, print count of set bits in it. 
For example, if the given number is 6(binary: 110), output should be 2 as there are two set bits in it.

Example:
Input:
2
6
11
Output:
2
3

Approach: Convert the given number to binary using bin method. It converts as 6 to 0b110
          To count 1 after b So, do slicing [2:].
          Use count('1') method to count number of ones and print them.
          
#code
t=int(input())
while t!=0:
    num = int(input())
    print(str(bin(num))[2:].count('1'))
    t=t-1
