DETECT CAPITAL
Given a word, you need to judge whether the usage of capitals in it is right or not.
We define the usage of capitals in a word to be right when one of the following cases holds:

All letters in this word are capitals, like "USA".
All letters in this word are not capitals, like "leetcode".
Only the first letter in this word is capital, like "Google".
Otherwise, we define that this word doesn't use capitals in a right way.
 
Example 1:

Input: "USA"
Output: True
 
Example 2:

Input: "FlaG"
Output: False

Approach: Take 3 string variables, cap, low and mix.
          First, convert the word to all upper case characters and store it in cap.
          Second, convert the word to all lower case characters and store it in low.
          Third, convert first letter to upper and other letters to lower case and store it in mix variable.
          If word matches any of the above variable then return true else return false.
          
#code
class Solution:
    def detectCapitalUse(self, word: str) -> bool:
        cap = word.upper()
        low = word.lower()
        mix = word[0].upper() + word[1:].lower()
        return word in [cap,low,mix]
