NUMBER COMPLEMENT
Given a positive integer, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

Note:
The given integer is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
You could assume no leading zero bit in the integer’s binary representation.

Example 1:
Input: 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 010. So you need to output 2.

Example 2:
Input: 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (no leading zero bits), and its complement is 0. So you need to output 0.

Approach: Find the number of bits in the number. 
          Find 2's power number of bits, subtract one and xor it with the given number.

#code
import math
class Solution:
    def findComplement(self, num: int) -> int:
        #no_of_bits = (int)(math.floor(math.log(num)/math.log(2))) + 1
        no_of_bits = (int)(math.floor(math.log(num) /math.log(2))) + 1; 
        return ((1 << no_of_bits) - 1) ^ num;
