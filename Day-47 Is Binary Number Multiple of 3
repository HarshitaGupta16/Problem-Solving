Is Binary Number Multiple of 3
The question ask us to find if the given binary number is the multiple of 3
Example:
Input:
2
011
100

Output:
1
0

Approach: Count the number of 1s at even position and number of 1s at odd position, store them in count_even and count_odd respectively.
          Subtract count_odd and count_even. 
          If the difference on dividing by 3 gives 0 as remainder, then return 1 i.e Yes, it is divisible
          else return 0 i.e. No, it is not divisible.


#code
def convert(s):
    num=int(s)
    #print(num)
    count_even=0
    count_odd=0
    while(num!=0):
        rem1 = num%10
        #print(rem1)
        if(rem1==1):
            count_odd+=1
        num=int(num//10)
        rem2 = int(num % 10)
        if(rem2 == 1):
            count_even+=1
        num=int(num//10)
        #print(num)
    if(abs(count_odd-count_even) % 3 == 0):
        print(1)
    else:
        print(0)

t=int(input())
while t>0:
    s=input()
    convert(s)
    t=t-1
