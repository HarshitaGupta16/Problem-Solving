STUDENT ATTENDANCE RECORD 1
You are given a string representing an attendance record for a student. The record only contains the following three characters:
'A' : Absent.
'L' : Late.
'P' : Present.
A student could be rewarded if his attendance record doesn't contain more than one 'A' (absent) or more than two continuous 'L' (late).
You need to return whether the student could be rewarded according to his attendance record.

Example 1:
Input: "PPALLP"
Output: True

Example 2:
Input: "PPALLL"
Output: False

Approach: If Student is Absent more than once then, return False.
          In the list now compare if we have 3 consecutive Late i.e. "L" then, return False.
          For all other conditions return True.
          
class Solution:
    def checkRecord(self, s: str) -> bool:
        if s.count('A') > 1:
            return False
        for i in range(len(s) - 2):
            if(s[i] == s[i+1] and s[i+1] == s[i+2] and s[i] == "L"):
                return False
        return True
