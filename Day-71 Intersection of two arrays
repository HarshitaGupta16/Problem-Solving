INTERSECTION OF TWO ARRAYS
Given two arrays A and B respectively of size N and M. 
The task is to print the count of elements in the intersection (or common elements) of the two arrays.
For this question, intersection of two arrays can be defined as the set containing distinct common elements between the two arrays.

Example:
Input:
4
5 3
89 24 75 11 23
89 2 4
6 5
1 2 3 4 5 6
3 4 5 6 7
4 4
10 10 10 10
20 20 20 20
3 3
10 10 10
10 10 10

Output:
1
4
0
1
 

Explanation:
Testcase 1: 89 is the only element in the intersection of two arrays.
Testcase 2: 3 4 5 and 6 are the elements in the intersection of two arrays.

Apprach: Initialize a set s and a list lis.
         Add each element of arr1 in set s.
         Now traverse arr2, check if the element of the arr2 lies in set s.
         If lies then this is the common element, so append this in list lis.
         Now print length of lis which tells the number of elements common in both arrays which is the intersection.
         
#code
t=int(input())
while t>0:
    n,k = list(map(int,input().strip().split()))
    arr1 = list(map(int,input().strip().split()))
    arr2 = list(map(int,input().strip().split()))
    s = set()
    lis=[]
    for i in range(n):
        s.add(arr1[i])
    #print(s)
    for i in range(k):
        if(arr2[i] in s):
            lis.append(arr2[i])
            s.remove(arr2[i])
            
    print(len(lis))
            
    t=t-1
