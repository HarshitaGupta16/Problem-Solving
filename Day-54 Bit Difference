BIT DIFFERENCE
You are given two numbers A and B. Write a program to count number of bits needed to be flipped to convert A to B.

Example:
Input:
1
10 20
Output:
4

Explanation:
Testcase1:
A  = 01010
B  = 10100
Number of bits need to flipped = 4

Approach: Two numbers are inputed. Perform xor operation between the 2 numbers and store it in variable x.
          xor operation gives 1 when bits are dissimilar i.e these dissimilar bits need to be changed to make two numbers same.
          So, count these number of 1s, which is the answer.
          
#code
t = int(input())
while t>0:
    a,b = input().split()
    a = int(a)
    b = int(b)
    x = a ^ b
    print(bin(x)[2:].count('1'))
    t=t-1
