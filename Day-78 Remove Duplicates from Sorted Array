REMOVE DUPLICATES FROM SORTED ARRAY
Given a sorted array nums, remove the duplicates in-place such that each element appear only once and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

Example 1:

Given nums = [1,1,2],
Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.

Example 2:

Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],
Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.

Approach: Use two pointer approach. 
          Initialize a variable j=0. 
          Start a for loop with i =0 to n-1 where n is the length of array.
          Compare the number wuth one next to it, if both are not equal then add it in the list.
          Increase the count of j. Now, return j, which is the length of the new array.
          
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        if(len(nums) == 1):
            return 1
        if(len(nums) == 0):
            return 0
        
        j = 0
        n = len(nums)
        for i in range(n-1):
            if(nums[i] != nums[i+1]):
                nums[j] = nums[i]
                j+=1
                
        nums[j] = nums[n-1]
        j+=1
        return j
